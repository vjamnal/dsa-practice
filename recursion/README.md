# Recursion

Recursive problem-solving approaches.

## Problems

1. **Fibonacci Sequence** - Classic recursion example
2. **Factorial** - Calculate n!
3. **Power of a Number** - Calculate x^n
4. **Palindrome Check** - Check if string is palindrome
5. **Tower of Hanoi** - Classic recursion puzzle

## Key Concepts

- Base case: Condition to stop recursion
- Recursive case: Function calls itself with modified input
- Call stack: Memory used for function calls

## Tips

- Always define clear base case(s)
- Ensure progress toward base case
- Consider iterative alternative for efficiency
- Watch for stack overflow with deep recursion

## Time Complexity

Varies by problem, often O(2^n) for tree recursion
