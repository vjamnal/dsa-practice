# Dynamic Programming

Problems solved using dynamic programming technique.

## Problems

1. **Climbing Stairs** - Count ways to climb n stairs
2. **House Robber** - Maximum money without robbing adjacent houses
3. **Coin Change** - Minimum coins to make amount
4. **Longest Common Subsequence** - Find LCS of two strings
5. **0/1 Knapsack** - Maximum value with weight constraint
6. **Edit Distance** - Minimum operations to convert string

## Key Concepts

- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems solved multiple times
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Memoization**: Top-down approach with caching
- **Tabulation**: Bottom-up approach filling table

## Common Patterns

- 1D DP: Fibonacci, climbing stairs
- 2D DP: Grid problems, LCS, knapsack
- State machine: Buy/sell stock problems

## Time Complexity

Usually O(n) or O(n²) depending on problem dimensions
