## File Format

Use the same header format as the main solutions:

```python
# problem: Problem Name
# approach: Your approach
# time: O(?)
# space: O(?)

"""
Problem description
"""

def solution():
    # Your code here
    pass
```

## Usage

1. Copy a problem from the main folders
2. Implement your own solution
3. Compare with the reference solution
4. Iterate and improve!
