# Sliding Window

Problems that use sliding window technique for subarray/substring problems.

## Problems

1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - Find longest unique substring
2. **Minimum Window Substring** - Find minimum window containing all characters
3. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K** - Find max sum of k consecutive elements
4. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement** - Find longest substring with same char after k replacements
5. **Permutation in String** - Check if one string is permutation of another's substring

## Technique

The sliding window technique maintains a window of elements and slides it through the array/string to find optimal solutions. Can be fixed-size or variable-size window.

## Time Complexity

Typically O(n) time, O(k) space where k is window size or character set size
