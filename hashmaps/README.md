# Hash Maps

Problems using hash maps (dictionaries) for O(1) lookups.

## Problems

1. **Two Sum** - Find two numbers that sum to target
2. **Group Anagrams** - Group strings that are anagrams
3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence** - Find longest consecutive sequence
4. **Valid Anagram** - Check if two strings are anagrams
5. **Subarray Sum Equals K** - Count subarrays with sum k

## Use Cases

- Fast lookups O(1)
- Counting frequencies
- Caching results
- Mapping relationships

## Time Complexity

- Insert: O(1) average
- Lookup: O(1) average
- Delete: O(1) average
