# Greedy Algorithms

Problems solved using greedy approach (making locally optimal choices).

## Problems

1. **Jump Game** - Can reach end of array
2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II** - Multiple transactions
3. **Gas Station** - Find starting gas station
4. **Meeting Rooms** - Schedule non-overlapping meetings
5. **Partition Labels** - Partition string into max parts

## Key Concepts

- **Greedy Choice Property**: Locally optimal choice leads to globally optimal solution
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- Not always guaranteed to work (vs DP which always works)

## When to Use Greedy

- Activity selection problems
- Huffman coding
- Minimum spanning tree
- Scheduling problems

## Time Complexity

Usually O(n log n) due to sorting, or O(n) for single pass
