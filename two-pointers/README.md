# Two Pointers

Problems that use two pointer technique for efficient solutions.

## Problems

1. **Two Sum II** - Find two numbers in sorted array
2. **Three Sum** - Find all triplets that sum to zero
3. **Container With Most Water** - Find container with max area
4. **Valid Palindrome** - Check palindrome using two pointers
5. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** - Remove duplicates in place

## Technique

The two-pointer technique uses two pointers moving toward each other or in the same direction to solve problems efficiently in O(n) time with O(1) space.

## Time Complexity

Typically O(n) time, O(1) space
